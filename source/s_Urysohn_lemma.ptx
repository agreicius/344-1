            <p>
            Let <m>X</m> be a normal space, and let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be two nonempty, closed, and disjoint subsets of <m>X</m>. Given any interval <m>[a,b]\subseteq \R</m>, there is a continuous function <m>f\colon X\rightarrow [a,b]</m> such that <m>f(A)=\{a\}</m> and <m>f(B)=\{b\}</m>.

        <proof>
            <p>
                It would be difficult to improve upon Munkres' exposition of this. I give essentially a full proof below nonetheless.
            </p>
            <proof>
                <title>Step 1: construction of open sets <m>U_p</m></title>
                    <p>
                      The first step in the proof is to build a collection of open sets <m>\{U_q\}_{p\in \Q}</m> satisfying 
                      <men xml:id="eq_ury_lemma">
                        p&lt; q\implies \overline{U_p}\subseteq U_{q}
                      </men>
                      for all <m>p,q\in \Q</m>. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Fix an enumeration <m>\Q=\{q_1,q_2,\dots,\}</m> (without repeats) where for convenience <m>q_1=1</m> and <m>q_2=0</m>. For each <m>n\geq 1</m>, let <m>Q_n=\{q_1,q_2,\dots, q_n\}</m>, the first <m>n</m> primes in our enumeration. We will recursively define a collection of open sets 
                      <me>
                        \{U_q\}_{q\in \Q}=\{U_{q_n}\}_{n\in \Z_+}
                    </me> 
                    such that for all <m>n\geq 1</m>, the finite collection <m>\mathcal{U}_n=\{U_{p_1}, U_{p_2}, \dots, U_{p_{n}}\}</m> satisfies the following condition 
                       <men xml:id="eq_ury_lemma_n">
                        p,q\in Q_n \text{ and } p&lt; q \implies \overline{U_p}\subseteq U_q
                       </men>.
                       It is easy to see that if <xref ref="eq_ury_lemma_n"/> holds for all <m>n</m>, then <xref ref="eq_ury_lemma"/> holds for all <m>p,q\in \Q</m>. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Base cases: first define <m>U_{q_1}=U_1=X-B</m>. Next, since <m>A\subseteq U_1</m> and <m>X</m> is normal, we can choose <m>U_{q_2}=U_0</m> to be any open set satisfying <me>
                            A\subseteq U_{0}\subseteq \overline{U_0}\subseteq U_1
                        </me>.
                        It is easy to see that <m>\mathcal{U}_n</m> satisfies <xref ref="eq_ury_lemma_n"/> for <m>n\leq 2</m>. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the recursive step, let <m>n\geq 2</m> and assume that we have chosen open sets <m>U_{q_1}, U_{q_2},\dots, U_{q_n}</m> such that the set <m>\mathcal{U}_n</m> satisfies <xref ref="eq_ury_lemma_n"/>. We choose <m>U_{q_{n+1}}</m> as follows.
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    If <m>q_{n+1}&gt; 1</m>, set <m>U_{q_{n+1}}=X</m>; if <m>q_{n+1}&lt; 0</m>, set <m>U_{q_{n+1}}=\emptyset</m>. 
                                </p>

                                    If <m>q_{n+1}\in (0,1)</m>, there exist unique elements <m>p,q\in Q_n</m> such that <m>p</m> is the greatest element of <m>Q_n</m> less than <m>q_{n+1}</m>, and <m>q</m> is the least element of <m>Q_n</m> greater than <m>q</m>. (Such elements exist since <m>q_2=0&lt; q_{n+1}&lt; 1=q_1</m>.) Since by induction <m>\overline{U_{p}}\subseteq U_{q}</m>,  using normality of <m>X</m>, we can pick <m>U_{q_{n+1}}</m> to be an open set satisfying 
                                    <me>
                                      \overline{U_{p}}\subseteq U_{q_{n+1}}\subseteq U_{q_{n+1}}\subseteq \overline{U_{q_{n+1}}}\subseteq U_q

                        </ul>  
                    It remains to show that the extended set <m>\mathcal{U}_{n+1}</m> still satisfies <xref ref="eq_ury_lemma_n"/>. Take any <m>p,q\in Q_{n+1}</m> with <m>p&lt; q</m>: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                If <m>p,q\in Q_n</m>, then <xref ref="eq_ury_lemma_n"/> is satisfied by the induction hypothesis. 
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Assume <m>p=q_{n+1}</m>. If <m>q_{n+1}&lt; 0</m>, we have <m>U_{q_{n+1}}=\emptyset</m> in which case clearly <xref ref="eq_ury_lemma_n"/> holds. Similarly, if <m>q_{n+1}&gt; 1</m>, then we must have <m>U_{q_{n+1}}=U_q=X</m>, in which case again <xref ref="eq_ury_lemma_n"/> clearly holds. Assume <m>q\in [0,1]</m>. Let <m>q'</m> be least element of <m>Q_{n+1}</m> that is greater than <m>q_{n+1}</m>. By definition we have 
                                <me>
                                    \overline{U_{q_{n+1}}}\subseteq U_{q'}\subseteq \overline{U_{q'}}\subseteq U_q

                                as desired.

                                Assume <m>q=q_{n+1}</m>. The argument proceeds in much the same way as immediately above.

                        </li>

                    <title>Step 2: definition of <m>f</m> and continuity</title>
                    <p>
                    Since the homeomorphism <m>g\colon [0,1]\rightarrow [a,b]</m> defined as <m>g(x)=(b-a)x+a</m> satisfies <m>g(0)=a</m> and <m>g(1)=b</m>, we see that it suffices to show that there is a continuous function <m>f\colon X\rightarrow [0,1]</m> satisfying <m>f(A)=0</m> and <m>f(B)=1</m>. We endeavor to do so below. 
                    </p>
                    <p> Define <m>f\colon X\rightarrow \R</m> as 
                    <me>
                        f(x)=\inf\{q\in \Q\colon x\in U_q\}
                    </me>.
                    The function <m>f</m> satisfies the following properties:
                    <mdn>
                        <mrow xml:id="eq_fprop1"> 
                            0\amp\leq f(x)\leq 1 </mrow>
                        <mrow xml:id="eq_fprop2"> 
                            x\in \overline{U_q}\amp\implies f(x)\leq q

                        <mrow xml:id="eq_fprop3"> x\notin U_q \amp \implies f(x)\geq q 
                        </mrow>
                    </mdn>.
                    Each of these properties is relatively straightforward to prove using properties of the infinum. For example, we have 
                    <md>
                        <mrow>x\in \oveline{U_q} \amp \implies x\in U_p \text{ for all } p\geq q </mrow>
                        <mrow> \amp \{p\colon x\in U_p\}\supseteq \{p\colon p\geq q\}</mrow>
                        <mrow> \amp \implies \inf\{p\colon x\in U_p\}\leq \inf\{p\colon p\geq q\}</mrow>
                        <mrow> \amp \implies f(x)\leq q</mrow>
                    </md>.
                    To see that <m>f</m> is continuous, fix any <m>x\in X</m> and open set <m>(a,b)</m> containing <m>y=f(x)</m>.  Choose rational numbers <m>p, q</m> satisfying 
                    <me>
                        a&lt; p&lt; y &lt; q &lt; b
                    </me>.
                    Claim: the set <m>U=U_q-\overline{U_p}</m> is an open set containing <m>x</m> satisfying 
                    <me>
                        f(U)=f(U_q-\overline{U_p})\subseteq [p,q]\subseteq (a,b)
                    </me>. 
                    First, it is clear that <m>U_q-\overline{U_p}</m> is open, and it follows easily from the elementary properties of <m>f</m> quoted above that <m>x\in U_q-\overline{U_p}</m>. Next, given any <m>x'\in U_q-\overline{U_p}</m>, since <m>x'\in \overline{U_q}</m>, we have <m>f(x')\leq q</m>, and since <m>x'\notin U_p</m>, we have <m>f(x')\geq p</m>. This concludes the proof.

         With respect to regularity, separation by a continuous function is truly a stronger notion: <ie/>, there are spaces that are regular but not completely regular. This is in contrast to the situation with normality: by Urysohn's lemma a space is normal if and only if disjoint closed sets are separated by a continuous function. Note also that by Urysohn's lemma, any normal space is completely regular. Thus adding <m>T_{3\frac{1}{2}}</m> to our list of <foreign>Trennungsaxiome</foreign> we still have a list of properties that satisfies <m>T_n\implies T_m</m> if <m>n\geq m</m>.

                The proof of (1) is elementary. (See text.) The proof of (2) is more interesting. Assume <m>\{X_i\}_{i\in I}</m> is a collection of completely regular spaces, and let <m>X=\prod_{i\in I}X_i</m>. Let <m>A\subseteq X</m> be a closed set, and let <m>b=(b_i)_{i\in I}</m> be any element not contained in <m>A</m>.

        <statement>
            <p>
            If <m>X</m> is a regular second countable space, then <m>X</m> is metrizable.

        </statement>
        <proof>
            <p>
                The main step in the proof, one that uses <xref ref="th_Urysohn_lemma"/>, is the construction of a countable family of continuous functions <m>\{f_n\colon X\rightarrow [0,1]\}_{n\in \Z_+}</m> satisfying the following property: for all <m>x\in X</m> and for all open sets <m>U</m> containing <m>x</m>, there is an <m>n\in \Z_+</m> such that <m>f_n(x)>0</m> and <m>f_n(X-U)=\{0\}</m>. It then follows from <xref ref="th_embedding_theorem"/> that the map <m>f\colon X\rightarrow \R^\omega</m> defined as <m>f(x)=(f_n(x))_{n\in \Z_+}</m> is an embedding into the metric space <m>\R^\omega</m>. Since subspaces of metric spaces are metric spaces, we conclude that <m>X</m> is metrizable. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We now proceed with the construction. Let <m>\mathcal{B}=\{B_1, B_2,\dots, \}</m> be a countable basis of <m>X</m>. For all <m>m,n\in \Z_+</m> satisfying <m>\overline{B_m}\subseteq B_n</m>, let <m>g_{m,n}\colon X\rightarrow [0,1]</m> be a continuous function satisfying <m>g_{m,n}(\overline{B_m})=\{1\}</m> and <m>g_{m,n}(X-B_n)=\{0\}</m>: this guaranteed to exist by <xref ref="th_Urysohn_lemma"/> since <m>X</m>, being regular and second countable, is normal. Since the collection <m>\{g_{m,n}\}</m> is countable we can enumerate it as <m>\{g_{m,n}\}=\{f_1, f_2,\dots\}</m>. Now, for any <m>x</m> and any open set <m>U\ni x</m>, we have <m>x\in B_n\subseteq U</m> for some <m>n\in \Z_+</m>. Since <m>X</m> is regular, we can find a basis element <m>B_m</m> such that <m>x\in \overline{B_m}\subseteq B_n</m>. We have <m>g_{m,n}=f_k</m> for some <m>k\in \Z_+</m>, <m>f_k(x)=1</m>, and <m>f_k(X-U)\subseteq f_k(X-B_m)=\{0\}</m>, as desired.

                Let <m>X</m> be a <m>T_1</m>-space. Given any collection of continuous functions <m>\{f_i\colon X\rightarrow \R\}_{i\in I}</m> satisfying the property that for all <m>x\in X</m> and for all open sets <m>U</m> containing <m>x</m> there is an <m>i\in I</m> such that <m>f_i(x)&gt; 0</m> and <m>f_i(X-U)=\{0\}</m>, the map <m>f\colon X\rightarrow \R^I</m> defined as <m>f(x)=(f_i(x))_{i\in I}</m> is an embedding into <m>\R^I</m>.

                    Since <m>X</m> is <m>T_1</m>, given any <m>x\ne y\in X</m> we can find an open set <m>U</m> such that <m>x\in U</m> and <m>y\notin U</m>. By assumption, there is some <m>i_0\in I</m> such that <m>f_{i_{0}}(x)&gt; 0</m> and <m>f_{i_0}(X-U)=\{0\}</m>. It follows that <m>f_{i_{0}}(x)\ne f_{i_0}(y)</m> and hence that <m>f(x)\ne f(y)</m>.

                This follows immediately from <xref ref="th_product_universal_prop"/> since each <m>f_i</m> is continuous.

                    Lastly, we prove that <m>f</m> is an embedding mapping <m>X</m> homeomorphically onto <m>f(X)\subseteq \R^I</m>. Let <m>U</m> be an open set containing an element <m>x\in X</m>, and let <m>y=f(x)\in f(U)</m>. Pick any <m>i_0\in I</m> such that <m>f_{i_0}(x)&gt; 0</m> and <m>f_{i_0}(X-U)=\{0\}</m>. Let <m>\pi_{i_0}\colon \R^I\rightarrow \R</m> be the projection map onto the <m>i_{0}</m>-th coordinate, and define <m>V=f(X)\cap \pi_{i_0}^{-1}((0,\infty))</m>. Since <m>\pi_{i_0}</m> is continuous and <m>(0,\infty)</m> is open, the set <m>V</m> is open in the subspace topology of <m>f(X)</m>. We claim that <m>y\in V\subseteq f(U)</m>, proving that <m>f</m> is an embedding. Since <m>\pi_{i_0}(y)=f_{i_0}(x)&gt; 0</m>, we have <m>y\in </m>. Similarly, if <m>y'=f(x')\in V</m>, then <m>\pi_{i_0}(y')=\pi_{i_0}(x')&gt; 0</m>, from whence it follows that <m>x'\in U</m>: otherwise we'd have <m>f_{i_0}(x')=0</m>.

        <title>Urysohn metrization theorem</title>
        <p>
            Munkres gives an alternative proof that shows any regular second countable space can be embedded into <m>\R^\omega</m> with respect to the uniform metric. This argument is then generalized later to prove the Nagata-Smirnov metrization theorem, which states that <m>X</m> is metrizable if and only if it is regular and has countable locally finite basis.

    <corollary xml:id="cor_completely_regular_embedding">
        <statement>
            <p>
                A space <m>X</m> is completely regular if and only if it is homeomorphic to a subspace of <m>[0,1]^I</m> for some set <m>I</m>. 
            </p>
        </statement>
        <proof>
            <p>
                Implication: <m>(\Rightarrow)</m>. Assume <m>X</m> is completely regular. Recall that in particular this means <m>X</m> is <m>T_1</m>. Define <m>I</m> to be the set of all pairs <m>(x, U)</m> where <m>x\in X</m> and <m>U</m> is an open neighborhood of <m>x</m>. For each <m>i=(x,U)</m>, let <m>f_i\colon X\rightarrow [0,1]</m> be a function satisfying <m>f(x)=1</m> and <m>f(X-U)=\{0\}</m>. (Such a function exists since <m>X</m> is completely regular.) Now, for all <m>x\in X</m> and for all open sets <m>U</m> containing <m>x</m>, corresponding to the index <m>i=(x,U)</m> we have the function <m>f_i</m> which satisfies <m>f_i(x)=1&gt; 0</m> and <m>f_i(X-U)=\{0\}</m>. We conclude by <xref ref="th_embedding_theorem"/> that the map <m>f(x)=(f_i(x))_{i\in I}</m> is an embedding of <m>X</m> into <m>\R^I</m>, and thus that <m>X</m> is homeomorphic to a subspace of <m>\R^I</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Implication: <m>(\impliedby)</m>. Since <m>\R</m> is completely regular, and since complete regularity is preserved under arbitrary products, the space <m>\R^I</m> is completely regular for any set <m>I</m>. Furthermore, since complete regularity is inherited by subspaces, any subspace of <m>\R^I</m> is completely regular. Thus, if <m>X</m> embeds into <m>\R^I</m>, then it is homeomorphic to a subspace of <m>\R^I</m>, and hence is completely regular.
